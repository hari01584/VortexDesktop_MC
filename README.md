# Vortex Desktop Connector (Win 10+) Bedrock Servers
> Allows you to play with your friends or random strangers, join hosted lobbies of minecraft and have fun! Allows you to crossplay server between android and windows bedrock! (Needs Android Vortex For it)!

This is [Vortex Connect(Android)](https://github.com/hari01584/VortexApp__MC) version ported to windows with some minimal features on the request of several users! *Please note that right now it only supports connection to servers in lobby, ie it doesn't allow you to host server or use the chat feature of android app, Please use android app to do these things!!!*

## Installation
Grab latest executable from [releases](https://github.com/hari01584/VortexDesktop_MC/releases/latest) and unzip it to a folder, Run **Vortex Desktop.exe**, After that all you have to do is to *double click on any server you would like to join (from the list) and Launch Minecraft Bedrock (Win10), Your server would be in Friends tab (Under LAN)!! :)*


## Development setup
Clone this repo and open it in visual studio, This app is made using wpf and hence might require you to download the same, After setting everything up you can just debug the app and modify stuffs to your needs! :)

Also you can also see [libWin10MinecraftTunnel](https://github.com/hari01584/libWin10MinecraftTunnel)(The library which makes link from server to minecraft) to go on even deeper level of customization and modification, The instructions to compile *bedrockProxy.exe* will be there in libWin10MinecraftTunnel library, So you can just compile executable and replace it with the one in *bedrockProxy100* folder for the changes to take effect! :)
